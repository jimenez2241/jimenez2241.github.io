**Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact I have chosen is a great example of a project that demonstrate some type of database. I create an animal shelter database to keep track of all animals that goes in and out of the shelter.  I created this project early 2021. This project is a great addition to my ePortfolio because it demonstrates a database. I created a database for an animal shelter to keep track of everything that happens in the shelter. I created a create, read, update, and delete function to be able to maintain the shelter. Then I linked it to my database to be able to use these functions. I then enhanced my project by using the CRUD function to add animals, read their profiles, update their profile, and delete any animals that is no longer in the shelter. I have met the course objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. This was a great addition to my ePortfolio. This enhancement was a great lesion for me. I took a project that I created and used it to manage another project. Sometimes one project could help another.
