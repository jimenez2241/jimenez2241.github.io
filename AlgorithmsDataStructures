**Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure**

The artifact that I have selected is a file I created to promote five destinations to travel. I created this project 3 years ago. I felt this project was a great addition to add to my ePortfolio. This project was a great example of Algorithms and Data Structure. This project demonstrates areas to travel to while promoting. This project has great data structure on places to travel. I improved this project by added more detail to each destination. I also added a title and upgraded some page features to make it pop more. I felt that I met the course objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. I feel this project is complete. My process on enhancing this project was to make the page stand out more. So, I updated what I felt would get more people to engage on this project and get them to take my advice on where to travel. While enhancing this project, I learn how to alter my project to a fit a certain criterion. This is great practice on taking what a customer needs and implementing it. While working on this project I didnâ€™t have any challenges.
