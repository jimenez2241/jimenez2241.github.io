# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Refinement Plan & Code Review


**Introduction**

I have been enrolled in a software engineer program for just about 3 years now. Throughout my journey, I have inquired some information that help me prepare my career as a software engineer. There are a few things that I pick up along my journey. Three things that I have learned are Variables, loops, and if/else statements. My future career relates to computer science because I would need the basic skills to create and maintain apps that collects data. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in software engineer, I will develop and maintain app for my company I work for. This will help me develop a good foundation on applying what I’ve learned and apply it to a real-life situation. I would like to specialize in cyber security or developing games. 

**ePortfolio Overall**

In my ePortfolio I must make sure my codes are clean and easy to understand. As going through my project, I will keep a checklist of what my code needs to be complete. I will make sure I go through every line of code to make sure it completed. For example, if I had an if else statement, I would make sure I have all aspects to be a if else statement. I also want to make sure my code is coded correctly. For example, I want to make sure the narrative of my code is correct. I want to have my code in order of the process. If I have my code that should be in the end at the beginning, then my code could suffer and fail. So, I want to go through each project and make sure my code has a good flow. As far as professional self-assessment I will make sure all the knowledge I gained thought my time is fresh. I will go over some materials like crucial information that would make me a great coder.

## Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design

For this portion of the project, I would like to use my project I created in CS 360 Architect and Programming. This is course I created an inventory app. This a great example to show how I created a mobile app that keep track of inventory. I decided to use this project for this section because it shows great software design. As you navigate throw the app you will see the design goes in line with the coding potion. The main objective of this project was to collect data to accurately display what is in stock. This app can also add or subtract the quantity amount per product. I plan to improve my code but poshing some of my code. When developing my project, I struggled with adding all the function my app needs to be able to run itself. The skills I gained in this project will help me improve my code to successfully have a complete inventory app. I want to enhance my code by added a better system to collect the data. For example, I have only had an add and delete button. To have an inventory app I also need a read only and update button as well. That will be a great start to making my inventory app enhanced.


The artifact that I choose to enhance is called pyramid. This project is a 3d visual scene of a few shapes I created. I created this about 1 year ago. This project is a great example of software design and engineering. This was one of the most difficult courses I took in my journey. I wanted to show that even when I struggled, I still made it through the other side. This artifact show I can adapt my coding knowledge to the task at hand. I improved this project by added a few more shapes and deleted what was not need in the project. I met most of the planned enhancements I set for myself in Module One. I feel like I have a few more things I would like to touch up. For example, I would like to add a background to my scene. This would go great with the shapes I created for it. My process of enhancing my artifact was to make everything as clean and easy to follow as possible. When going through my process, I learned that sometimes its not as easy as it looks. For example, I haven’t touched this project for a long time. So, coming back to it was a little difficult to remember all the libraries I need to enhance it. My biggest issue is debugging my project. I need to get better with doing that so I can ensure my code is the best it can possibly be.

**Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure**

For this portion of the project, I would like to use my project I created in CS 260 Data Structures and Algorithms. The project I created is a Binary Search Tree. A binary tree is a great for searching and sorting. I created a binary tree because its very flexible when it comes to holding and moving data. Also, I can add nodes to the tree to make it bigger. I have a better understanding what a binary tree is and what it is used for. Now I would like to expand on this project’s complexity. I want to create a binary tree in another project. I would like to add to this project, so the algorithms and data structures is more efficient and complex. Creating a project with a binary tree will help me search faster with a big database. 

The artifact that I have selected is a file I created to promote five destinations to travel. I created this project 3 years ago. I felt this project was a great addition to add to my ePortfolio. This project was a great example of Algorithms and Data Structure. This project demonstrates areas to travel to while promoting. This project has great data structure on places to travel. I improved this project by added more detail to each destination. I also added a title and upgraded some page features to make it pop more. I felt that I met the course objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. I feel this project is complete. My process on enhancing this project was to make the page stand out more. So, I updated what I felt would get more people to engage on this project and get them to take my advice on where to travel. While enhancing this project, I learn how to alter my project to a fit a certain criterion. This is great practice on taking what a customer needs and implementing it. While working on this project I didn’t have any challenges. 

**Enhancement Three: Databases**

For this portion of the project, I would like to use my project I created in CS 340 Advanced Programming Concepts. The project I want to use for my ePortfolio is the animal shelter. This project show how I created a database of animals that goes in and out of a shelter. I first created a database so I can add information into it. I then created function that will create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) information. With these functions I can alter the information in the database. For this code I would like to transfer this project into a different language. Creating CRUD functions is a necessity when dealing with databases. I am planning to add this function to maintain an animal shelter. This would be able to do everything an animal shelter need to be able to be organized while keeping track of all the animals that enters and leaves the shelter. 

The artifact I have chosen is a great example of a project that demonstrate some type of database. I create an animal shelter database to keep track of all animals that goes in and out of the shelter.  I created this project early 2021. This project is a great addition to my ePortfolio because it demonstrates a database. I created a database for an animal shelter to keep track of everything that happens in the shelter. I created a create, read, update, and delete function to be able to maintain the shelter. Then I linked it to my database to be able to use these functions. I then enhanced my project by using the CRUD function to add animals, read their profiles, update their profile, and delete any animals that is no longer in the shelter. I have met the course objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. This was a great addition to my ePortfolio. This enhancement was a great lesion for me. I took a project that I created and used it to manage another project. Sometimes one project could help another.
