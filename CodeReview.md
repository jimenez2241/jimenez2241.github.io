# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Refinement Plan & Code Review


**Introduction**

I have been enrolled in a software engineer program for just about 3 years now. Throughout my journey, I have inquired some information that help me prepare my career as a software engineer. There are a few things that I pick up along my journey. Three things that I have learned are Variables, loops, and if/else statements. My future career relates to computer science because I would need the basic skills to create and maintain apps that collects data. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in software engineer, I will develop and maintain app for my company I work for. This will help me develop a good foundation on applying what I’ve learned and apply it to a real-life situation. I would like to specialize in cyber security or developing games. 

**Category One: Software Engineering/Design**

For this portion of the project, I would like to use my project I created in CS 360 Architect and Programming. This is course I created an inventory app. This a great example to show how I created a mobile app that keep track of inventory. I decided to use this project for this section because it shows great software design. As you navigate throw the app you will see the design goes in line with the coding potion. The main objective of this project was to collect data to accurately display what is in stock. This app can also add or subtract the quantity amount per product. I plan to improve my code but poshing some of my code. When developing my project, I struggled with adding all the function my app needs to be able to run itself. The skills I gained in this project will help me improve my code to successfully have a complete inventory app. I want to enhance my code by added a better system to collect the data. For example, I have only had an add and delete button. To have an inventory app I also need a read only and update button as well. That will be a great start to making my inventory app enhanced.

**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

For this portion of the project, I would like to use my project I created in CS 260 Data Structures and Algorithms. The project I created is a Binary Search Tree. A binary tree is a great for searching and sorting. I created a binary tree because its very flexible when it comes to holding and moving data. Also, I can add nodes to the tree to make it bigger. I have a better understanding what a binary tree is and what it is used for. Now I would like to expand on this project’s complexity. I want to create a binary tree in another project. I would like to add to this project, so the algorithms and data structures is more efficient and complex. Creating a project with a binary tree will help me search faster with a big database. 

**Category Three: Databases**

For this portion of the project, I would like to use my project I created in CS 340 Advanced Programming Concepts. The project I want to use for my ePortfolio is the animal shelter. This project show how I created a database of animals that goes in and out of a shelter. I first created a database so I can add information into it. I then created function that will create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) information. With these functions I can alter the information in the database. For this code I would like to transfer this project into a different language. Creating CRUD functions is a necessity when dealing with databases. I am planning to add this function to maintain an animal shelter. This would be able to do everything an animal shelter need to be able to be organized while keeping track of all the animals that enters and leaves the shelter. 

**ePortfolio Overall**

In my ePortfolio I must make sure my codes are clean and easy to understand. As going through my project, I will keep a checklist of what my code needs to be complete. I will make sure I go through every line of code to make sure it completed. For example, if I had an if else statement, I would make sure I have all aspects to be a if else statement. I also want to make sure my code is coded correctly. For example, I want to make sure the narrative of my code is correct. I want to have my code in order of the process. If I have my code that should be in the end at the beginning, then my code could suffer and fail. So, I want to go through each project and make sure my code has a good flow. As far as professional self-assessment I will make sure all the knowledge I gained thought my time is fresh. I will go over some materials like crucial information that would make me a great coder.
