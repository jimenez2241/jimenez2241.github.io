## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Category One: Software Engineering/Design**

For this category, I have chosen to work with my CS 330 Final Project. This artifact was code written in C++ that used OpenGL to render an object in three-dimensional space. My plan to enhance this artifact is to increase the complexity of the model, in this case a drinking cup, as well as adding other objects, textures, and lighting to simulate an environment. In addition, my plan is to add more camera controls for the user. The enhancement of this artifact will demonstrate my ability to create more robust and efficient code.

**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

For this category, I have chosen to work with my IT 145 Final Project. This code was a simple authentication system for a Zoo that was written in Java. This authentication system was able to read inputs from the user and check to see if these inputs matched a text file. My plan to enhance this code is to rewrite the code in Visual Basic and add GUI elements for the user. Additionally, Iâ€™d like to expand upon the various roles that were originally built in to the system and allow them to do different things. I also plan to use an array to store data for various types of animals and implement a sorting feature improve access times in this array. This will demonstrate my ability to address security vulnerabilities with authentication and allow me to employ algorithms in my code.
  
**Category Three: Databases**

For this category, I have chosen to work with a data file from the DAT 220 Final Project. This data was regarding customers of a specific store with both a physical and online presence. For this artifact, I would like to create a MongoDB interface to allow a user to quickly search for data within the file. Some of the queries I would like to implement are for simple searches within each field, as well as the ability to query for customer data by state, city, age bracket, etc.
